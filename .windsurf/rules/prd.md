🧠 Overall Idea
This is a modern, all-in-one AI-powered academic support platform designed for students of all levels. It helps them study smarter, stay organized, and understand difficult concepts using cutting-edge AI.
At its core, the app works by letting students upload study materials (like class notes, textbooks, PDFs, handwritten images, etc.), and then it automatically generates helpful tools such as flashcards, quizzes, summaries, and even a podcast or video. There’s also a general-purpose AI tutor chatbot, as well as document-specific chatbots that help students directly based on what they upload.
The goal is to replace expensive tutors and clunky study tools with one beautifully connected app that does it all automatically.

🧰 Tools & Modules (Think of These as the Core Pillars)
Every uploaded study material gets the following tools generated automatically:
Flashcard Generator – Pulls key terms, definitions, and concepts from the material.


Summary Tool – Creates easy-to-read bullet-point summaries.


Quiz Generator – Builds multiple-choice, short-answer, and fill-in-the-blank quizzes.


Practice Test Generator – Creates full-length mock exams with varied question types.


Podcast Generator – Turns the document into an audio lesson (using AI voice).


Each tool is tied directly to a specific uploaded document and appears in that document’s dashboard.

🧩 AI Chatbots (Crucial Detail)
There are two kinds of chatbots in the app:
General Chatbot ("AI Study Buddy")


Accessible across the entire app.


Works like a general-purpose tutor: users can paste in questions, get explanations, help with assignments, etc.


It does NOT have memory of uploaded documents unless the user includes the content in their prompt.


Per-Document Chatbots


Every uploaded document has its own chatbot trained on that specific content.


When a student opens a document, they can chat with the AI about that material only.


Useful for asking “Can you explain this section?” or “Make a mnemonic for this paragraph” or “Generate a test from this page.”



🔄 How Everything Connects (Workflow)
Here’s how it works for a student:
📥 Upload Workflow:
Student uploads a PDF, textbook scan, image of notes, or class slides.


App runs it through OCR (if needed) and extracts clean text.


The system creates a document dashboard for this material with:


Flashcards


Summary


Quizzes


Practice test


Podcast


Document-specific chatbot


🧑‍🎓 Study Workflow Example:
Student uploads Chapter 3 of their History textbook.


They review the summary and flashcards to get a quick overview.


They take a short quiz and see where they’re weak.


They ask the document chatbot, “Explain the Cold War section in simple terms.”


They generate a podcast to listen to while walking.


Before the exam, they use the practice test tool to simulate the test.


🔄 General Workflow Example:
A student comes to the app and just wants to ask for help with a math problem.


They open the general chatbot, paste in the question, and the AI helps step-by-step.


If they have a worksheet, they upload it and then switch to the document chatbot to get help just from that file.

🌐 App Structure Overview (Conceptual)
Home Page: Overview of recent activity, recommended actions, upcoming events.


Library: All uploaded documents, each with its own dashboard and tools.


Tool Pages (per document): Flashcards, quiz, test, podcast, video, chatbot.


Chat Area: Split into General Chatbot and Document Chatbot views.


Study Planner: Calendar view with suggested tasks.


User Profile: Tracks streaks, badges, XP, and progress.



✅ Final Notes
Everything should feel student-friendly, beautiful, and responsive.


Prioritize simplicity and automation — users should barely need to click.


Every feature should be connected to each other. For example:


A quiz can be taken directly after reading the summary.


The chatbot should be able to refer to the flashcards if asked.


The planner can suggest “Take a quiz on Chapter 2.”
