1. Feature Overview
Name: Document Chatbot

Purpose: Give each uploaded document (PDF, notes image, textbook scan, etc.) its own dedicated AI tutor that “knows” only that content and can answer questions, explain passages, and generate study aids on the fly.

2. Core Capabilities
Context-Aware Q&A

Student asks a question about a specific section.

Chatbot refers only to that document’s text to answer.

Deep Explanation Mode

On request (“Explain this in simple terms,” “Give me an analogy”), the bot expands or reframes content.

3. Example User Workflows
Workflow A: Clarify a Tough Concept
Student opens “Biology Chapter 5” document.

Types: “Explain the Krebs cycle in simple terms.”

Chatbot pulls that exact section, breaks it down step by step, and offers a one-sentence summary.


Workflow C: Guided Review Path
Student says: “I have an exam tomorrow on all of Chapter 2.”

Chatbot outlines a 30-minute review plan:

5 mins: key definitions

10 mins: flashcard drill

10 mins: practice questions

5 mins: summary re-read

4. Key Use Cases
Exam Prep: Fast, document-specific Q&A and practice tests.

Homework Help: Step-by-step solutions referencing the student’s own notes.

Concept Mastery: On-demand analogies, simplifications, and deeper dives.

Study Scheduling: Document-driven micro-sessions integrated into the planner.

5. UX & Integration Notes
Access Point: “Chat” tab on each document’s dashboard.

UI Tone: Friendly tutor persona, with a clean chat bubble interface.

Memory Scope: Chatbot “remembers” previous questions in that session but never leaks content from other documents.

Performance: Responses should load under 2 seconds to keep study flow smooth.

6. Conversion & Engagement Goals
Immediate “Aha!” Moments: First question answered must be so clear the user feels it’s worth exploring more.


Retention Hooks: “You’ve asked 3 questions—earn your first badge!”

Your mission:
Use this spec to design, wireframe, and then build the Document Chat feature—tying it seamlessly into our existing UI and conversion-focused flows. Show me the initial design outline for review before diving into code.
